                            Eva is a Bulgarian-Canadian violinist specializing in orchestral performance and recently
                            reconnecting with her Balkan roots. She holds degrees from the University of British
                            Columbia and the University of Denver. A versatile musician, Eva is active across Colorado,
                            Wyoming, and Alberta, and frequently spends summers performing in Europe. Passionate about
                            leadership, she has held numerous principal positions, serving as concertmaster of the Rocky
                            Mountain Symphony Orchestra and of the University of Denver's Lamont Symphony Orchestra,

                            Festival Contemporary Orchestra. Eva's Bulgarian heritage has inspired her to explore the
                            Klezmer tradition in its many forms, particularly where it intersects with Balkan folk
                            music. Beyond the violin, Eva is passionate about adventure and exploration as she walks,
                            runs, and climbs through various mountain ranges. </p>
